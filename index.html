  <h2>All paths lead back to me.</h2>
  <blockquote>“What if every living thing in the universe — past, present, and future — is you?”<br>— Nitshanchai</blockquote>

    <h2>What is EERT?</h2>
    <p>EERT is a soul philosophy.</p>
    <p>It teaches that every person, every living thing, is part of the same soul — scattered across time and space, learning through different lives, slowly remembering who we really are.</p>
    <p>We’re not separate. We’re not strangers. We’re all pieces of the same whole, walking different paths — but heading toward the same place: <strong>Home.</strong></p>
    <p>EERT is not a religion. It doesn’t ask you to believe in anything. It asks you to remember.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every act of kindness is an act of healing yourself.</li>
      <li>Every harm you cause, you will one day feel — because one day, you’ll become the one who was hurt.</li>
      <li>Every lesson, every challenge, every person you meet… is part of your soul’s return to wholeness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To live by EERT is to live with awareness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What am I learning in this moment?</li>
      <li>How can I treat others as if they are me?</li>
      <li>What would life look like if we all remembered?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>EERT is about becoming whole again. Not by being perfect — but by being honest. By choosing compassion. By seeing every step, even the painful ones, as part of the way back.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to have all the answers. You just need to remember the truth that’s already inside you.</p>
    <p><strong>You are not broken. You are returning.</strong></p>
